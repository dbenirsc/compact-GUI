# compact-GUI

Contains files for running SEEK Compact thermal imager over USB and a minimal GUI to control and collect calibrated Data. 

ServerRecord.py was originally a standalone file, but has since become a library to contain functions for myqt_cal.py which is the file to be ran and use the GUI.

Pyqtgraph can be downloaded and installed from here http://pyqtgraph.org/.
